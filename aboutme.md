Hello, my name is Nisha Arya Ahmed. I am a 23 year old Briton who lives in London, UK. I have taken a new path which involves me taking on the world of technology. This is a world that I do not know much about. I am a current student at Lambda School studying Data Science for Artificial Intelligence. 

I have a love for the health and well-being sector. This was sparked from my experience as a Skincare therapist and my interest of studying Pharmacology at University. In my spare time, I spend alot of time at the gym either doing some HIIT training or a boxing class. I would like to start Muay Thai and eventually get involved in White Collar Muay Thai. 

I want to use the skills that I learn at Lambda to help me create solutiions to problems in the health and well-being industry, including the beautifying and medicinal world. 

This is the start to my Data Science journey. 

Stay for the ride.
